Changelog:

v1.1
- added html static site

v1.0
- everything in place!

=======================================================

This theme uses SCSS as a basis for styling. It also uses compass for different mixins.

The package contains a rails app to get you started super fast, and a middleman app (which is more lightweight) which can build a static html site for you (check out http://middlemanapp.com for more infos - it's super easy to install and use!)

It also contains a static site with just the plain html/css/js/images if all you need is that

To use it with rails, run the bundle command, and just start the server. Magic!
