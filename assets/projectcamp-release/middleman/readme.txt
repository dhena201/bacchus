to run the project with middleman:

- read the docs at http://middlemanapp.com
- run "gem install middleman"
- from the project's root directory (the one with the source) run "bundle install"
- "middleman server"

then check out http://localhost:4567

-----

or you can just grab the scss files from the source/stylesheets directory and embed them in your own project
